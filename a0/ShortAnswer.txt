1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?
This approach is misleading because number of followers are not same for this candidates.
DrJillStein and GovGaryJohnson has 1648 and 3481 followers respectively, 
HillaryClinton and realDonaldTrump has 762 and 45 followers respectively. 
As DrJillStein and GovGaryJohnson are following lot more peoples,
their common followers(friends_overlap) are more than the friends_overlap of HillaryClinton and realDonaldTrump.

we can calculate the percentage of common friends with total friends between this candidates.
common friend between DrJillStein and GovGaryJohnson are 238
common friend between HillaryClinton and realDonaldTrump are 1
so for DrJillStein:- 238/1648*100= 14.44%
so for GovGaryJohnson:- 238/3481*100= 6.83%
so for HillaryClinton:- 1/762*100=  0.13%
so for realDonaldTrump:- 1/45*100=  2.22

so the difference between percentages of common friends between DrJillStein and GovGaryJohnson is 7.61%
so the difference between percentages of common friends between HillaryClinton and realDonaldTrump is 2.09%

As the difference between percentages of common friends between HillaryClinton and realDonaldTrump are less than percentages of common friends between DrJillStein and GovGaryJohnson they are more similar


2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.
Answer:-

After looking at the output I found both HillaryClinton and realDonaldTrump follows user WhiteHouse.
Whitehouse is a workspace of the president of United States and this both were candidates for president election conducted in 2016.
So they both follows user WhiteHouse.  




3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?
Answer:-

Gary Johnson is a member of Libertarian Party and was a nominee for usa presidential election of 2016 and Donald Trump is a winner of the election 2016 and president of usa so he is more 
famous, popular and established personality in the entire world and so he follows very less peoples. Gary Johnson is not famous compared to Donald trump so he follows more people to get 
more famous among everyone and want to make a great profile.
This affect our analysis because if we calculate common friends of any user with Gary Johnson we will get more friends overlap as compared to the friends overlap between that user 
with Donald Trump. So it can mislead if we consider only friend_overlap function to find similarity(as stated in question 1).






4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?
Answer:-

All our 4 candidates have 1648 ,3481, 762 and 45 friends respectively. So total friends of 4 candidates are 5936. So we need to make more 5936 request. 
Due to twitter rate limiting, 15 requests per rate limit window.
So for GET requests: 15 calls every 15 minutes.
As we have 5936 friends we need to make 5936 request.so approximately it will take 5936 minutes plus some execution time to collect the entire data.
